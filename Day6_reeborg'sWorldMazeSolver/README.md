🔍 Overview

On Day 6 of my 100 Days of Python Journey, I solved the Reeborg’s World Maze Challenge — a logic-based problem where the robot must navigate a maze to reach its goal. This challenge introduced me to loops, conditionals, and functions working together to make an automated decision-making system.

⚙️ Features

Uses while loops for continuous navigation until the goal is reached.

Implements conditional checks like wall_in_front(), right_is_clear(), and at_goal() to guide Reeborg.

Demonstrates modular logic with helper functions like turn_right().

Mimics real-world pathfinding logic using the right-hand rule.

💻 How to Run

This program runs inside Reeborg’s World — an interactive web environment for Python learning.
To try it yourself:

Go to https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html

Select the “Maze” world.

Paste the above code and watch Reeborg solve it step by step!

🧠 Learning Outcomes

Gained confidence using while loops for automation.

Understood how nested conditionals can simulate real-world decision-making.

Practiced function abstraction to simplify repetitive logic.

Learned that patience and debugging are key when things don’t move (literally 😅).
